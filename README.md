Submitted For : Hexiwear Contest - Due date Oct 9, 2016

Tennis VibrAnalyzer measures vibrations travelling through
the hand as result of the racket hitting the ball.

This utilizes the "transient acceleration" function provided
by the NXP FXOS8700CQ Accelerometer/Magnetometer combo chip.

See "AN4461" document from NXP for more information on transient
acceleration.

This Analyzer provides a "Start"/"Stop" buttons to start/stop the analysis.

When stopped, the app displays the result of the analysis.

Pressing "Stop" again, resets the analysis and clears the app for the next
analysis session.
